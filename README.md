# Cornish Holiday Cottages

Cornish Holiday Cottages is a fictitious tourism and property management firm based in the South West of England. I've been tasked by this firm with creating a bespoke wordpress theme for the AWT Advanced Web Development A2 Project which is part of my BSc Applied Computing Degree.

## Assignment Introduction

> You are contracted as a developer for Cornish Holiday Cottages, a tourism and property management firm that provides a white-label website template, booking and marketing product for owners of multiple properties and/or holiday homes.  The company specialises in larger, premium, holiday cottages and lets, as well as unique converted buildings.  The company is proud to include a castle, converted lighthouse and WWII military base in its portfolio. 
> 
> The company wants to design a “off the shelf” website solution for its clients that can be quickly deployed and populated and branded to fit its individual clients.  The company wants to provide a consistent appearance across all of its clients, whilst providing a limited scope for clients to customise their property portfolio.  Customers will need to be able to access and change their content via a suitable mainstream CMS platform. 
> 
> Since the sites are normally the main marketing tool for its clients it is important that the site is accessible, complies with all key best practices, meets all legislative requirements, and has a strong focus on SEO. 
> 
> Reliability and performance are also very important, and you will be required to set up and optimise web deployment and provide performance data to support your platform and configuration. 

## Task 1 - Project Planning

> Based upon the project brief, you are required to design a solution to meet your client’s requirements.  The following design documentation is required: 
> - Annotated Wireframe Diagrams of key website templates (eg Home, Property, Gallery) 
> - A sample website page demonstrating design and content. 
> 
> Your application designs may be created in a graphics package of your preference.  This can include traditional graphics packages, e.g. Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, or UI/UX wireframe tools, including Adobe Xd, Wireframe.cc and FulidUI may also be used to aid your designs.  

## Task 2 - Development

> You are required to build a deployable project or ‘theme’ providing the key functionality listed below.  The layout of all pages should be restrictive, ensuring a consistent, professional appearance across the platform. Although you do not need to create content, a sample site with demo content must be developed to showcase your platform working. 
> 
> Remember this is a white-label product, so all areas must be editable and not specific to one company or property. 

## Task 3 - Hosting Environment

> You are required to spec, set up and configure a suitable hosting environment and demonstrate that your platform works on your hosting environment, balancing cost and performance. 
> 
> You will be required to benchmark your platform in Task 4.   

## Task 4 - Documentation, Testing and Benchmarking

> ### Admin Technical Manual / Deployment Guide 
> 
> You are required to provide supporting technical documentation.  This should include: 
> 
> - Technical requirements/recommended specification for running your application 
> - Setup/deployment guide 
> - Key Admin Features. 
> 
> ### Benchmarking & Performance 
> 
> You are also required to demonstrate that your application meets performance expectations and can evidence results.  Provide performance analysis including: 
> - Page payload/size 
> - Response times 
> - Page load times 
> 
> You should also make recommendations as to how performance may be improved.
